Using a \nlabelled dataset  of 53 attributes of which 28 are base attributes  and 25 are derived attributes.  \nEffect of COVID19 on People's Health/Nutritional Habits and Preferences (Statistics)  \nObjective:  Through this study, we try to understand the effects of COVID -19 on the health / nutritional preferences (mainly \nsleep, diet a nd exercise) of people. Impact:  We inferred that there was indeed an impact on these three factors. While the \nimpact was positive on sleep and diet routines, the impact on exercise routines observed turned out to be slightly negative. \nDataset : Collected 52  data points using a survey distributed through google form over a week\u2019s period.  \n \nSkills  \n Key Skills:  Statistics, Machine Learning, Visualizations, Microsoft Excel (Advance), Flask  \n Programming Languages:  Python, MySQL, NLP, Web Scraping (Selenium), Java, VBA (Basic)  \n Visualization Tools:  Tableau, Power BI  \n \nEducation",
